I understand that some people don't care about some of those things on their own but in combination I cannot believe that anyone would still be on Kinder Morgan's side. Do your research! Look at this project from all angles. You'd be just as shocked and disgusted as I am.,2018-05-22 21:09:34,999034560133316608,7,1,-0.6549

@camrclark @BenAtkinsonPhD @CanadianPM @joycemurray Semantics. Out here the two are interchangeable &amp; Kinder Morgan is more commonly used. Hence  your meaning was unclear to me. I accept that you see a difference.,2018-05-22 21:06:48,999033861660028929,0,0,0.5859
@LouiseinBC @TheLeap_Org For me  the focus among ENGOs on Kinder Morgan is understandable and also too much - I agree that Site C is a travesty that merits more and more visible resistance.,2018-05-22 21:06:17,999033730160300033,2,0,0.5719

Canada is totally fucked -look at this battle between 2 Socialist leaders of their province @jjhorgan and @RachelNotley.  Same party but BC is really ruled by the green tree huggers with only 3% of seats but have the balance of power.https://t.co/c9F4tahot7 #dontinvestincanada,2018-05-22 20:53:29,999030510553722880,0,0,0.1787
